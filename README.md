# Brian Almazo

This is my personal resume website that I built for my web development class. It's hosted on GitHub Pages and showcases my experience, projects, and skills.

## What's Inside

The site includes:
- My work experience (Humana, Unadat, Hunter College ICIT)
- Projects I've worked on (JP Morgan Code for Good, AI Running Coach, MTA Accessibility Analysis)
- Skills and technologies I know
- Education background from Hunter College

## Tech Stack

Built with plain HTML and CSS - no frameworks needed for this one. I wanted to focus on understanding the fundamentals first.

- HTML5 with semantic tags
- CSS3 with some gradient styling
- Hosted on GitHub Pages

## Running Locally

If you want to check it out locally, just clone the repo and open `index.html` in your browser. That's it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BrianAlmaz0/brianalmaz0.github.io.git
cd brianalmaz0.github.io
open index.html
```

## Files

- `index.html` - main page with all my info
- `styles.css` - styling and layout
- `REFLECTION.md` - write-up about HTTP requests and Docker vs GitHub Pages (assignment requirement)
- `assets/` - just has my profile photo
